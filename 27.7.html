Energy is critical to the economic growth and social development of any country. Indigenous energy resources need to be developed to the optimum level to minimize dependence on imported fuels, subject to resolving economic, environmental and social constraints. This led to a boost in research and development as well as investment in renewable energy industry in search of ways to meet energy demand and to reduce dependency on fossil fuels ,Wind and solar energy are becoming popular owing to abundance, availability and ease of harnessing for electrical power generation. This project focuses on an integrated hybrid renewable energy system consisting of wind and solar energy,many parts of the country have potential to developed economic power generation in Libya. Through maps locations were identified where both wind and solar potential is high. The focal point of this project is to propose and evaluate a wind-solar hybrid power generation system for a selected location. Grid tied power generation systems make use of solar PV or wind turbines to produce electricity and supply the load by connecting to grid. In this study,
 HOMER (Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable) computer modeling software was used to model the power system, its physical
 behavior and its life cycle cost.
